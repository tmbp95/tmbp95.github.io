### Q2: One of the NPM packages is not working (compiling Sass, live-reload, etc). How to fix it?

Unfortunately, this is quite common. I listed some possible fixes [in this document](npm-fixes.md).

### Q3: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you extensively tried fixing the problem on your own? If you failed at fixing it, please **post a detailled description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help as fast as possible! Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

### Q8: The videos don't load, can you fix it?

**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy's platform, and sometimes they have small technical issues like this one. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us). Also, don't forget to select the HD option in the video player.

**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/newsletter). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥

### Q11: Can I connect with your other students in some way?

**A:** Yep, I thought about this! I started quite an active Discord chatroom for you to chat with other students, help each other out or just hang out with like-minded people. You can [join using this invite](https://discord.gg/0ocsLcmnIZqxMSYD).
